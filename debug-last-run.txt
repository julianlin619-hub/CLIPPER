[0] Guest: Hey. Slow.
[1] Guest: But
[2] Guest: that
[3] Guest: was that was actually I just did that for, like, ten minutes.
[4] Guest: Okay. Who's up next?
[5] Guest: Who's on first?
[6] Guest: Got one.
[7] Guest: Lofty ambitions be achieved, a country with socialist and communist system.
[8] Guest: I think if you bribe people, yes.
[9] Guest: Sir, I'm broke. I read $100,000,000 book, but I don't have any idea about the product.
[10] Guest: Passion? Profession? Should we have somebody on? We good? Alright. Let's go.
[11] Guest: It's up the pace. Let's go. Revenue?
[12] Guest: What you sell, what the problem is.
[13] Guest: Strong silent type. I can appreciate that.
[14] Guest: A stoic, if you will.
[15] Guest: They're like, don't wanna tell you what my problems are nor my revenue.
[16] Guest: When is $100,000,000 sales coming? Oh, it will be quite dirty, Abdullah.
[17] Guest: Abdullah Tahir, it will be it will be nasty. How do you research an industry and know its parameters for acquisition?
[18] Guest: You can act you just literally just Google it and look at EBITDA multiples. But at the end of the day, what is someone here? Can someone hear me?
[19] Guest: Yes. Alright. Let's rock. Revenue,
[20] Guest: business,
[21] Guest: and problem.
[22] Host: My name is Matthew. I sell premium catering experiences to private clients looking to celebrate milestone events in Sydney. Great. We do about 2,800,000.0
[23] Host: this year with 40% net profit. I would like to be 8,000,000 in two years. Let's go. The main constraint is season seasonality.
[24] Host: So we do about 65%
[25] Host: of our annual revenue in six months. And if I don't solve this,
[26] Host: I either say no to demand in summer or I am supply constrained in sorry.
[27] Host: Or I am overstuffed in winter.
[28] Guest: Yeah.
[29] Guest: So
[30] Guest: one thing right off the bat I will say is that this is a feature, not a bug of the industry that you're in. Right? Same thing as lawn care guys, same thing as guys who do snow plowing. It's just a it's a super common thing. Swimming pools sometimes, obviously, in the summer. So, like, there there are industries that are just going to be more smoothies if you have summer versus Italian ice store. Like, there's a lot, right,
[31] Guest: that are seasonal. Now
[32] Guest: couple questions. So catering,
[33] Guest: what is your what is your hot season again?
[34] Host: Busy season. Yeah. What is the busy season?
[35] Host: Pretty much September through February.
[36] Guest: Okay.
[37] Guest: And so from now until September is when it's slow.
[38] Host: Yes. So what why are people not celebrating from now until September?
[39] Guest: Actually, I'm not even sure. It's a festive season. I I think yeah. It's it's not it's not as much of a festive season. I think people don't spend as much money going through winter.
[40] Host: Don't know if any of that has to do with
[41] Guest: But you still have, like in general. East don't worry about economy. They get whatever.
[42] Guest: I would just remove economy from from Lexington. There's nothing you can do about it. So okay. So people don't do Easter. You don't do corporate events?
[43] Host: We do do corporate. Yes. So we tie our corporate through winter more so. They have spent a lifetime value, but they have lower spend per per event, which lowers gross profit. So Okay. We do market more or less exclusively to to private.
[44] Guest: Okay. I'm just like it actually doesn't sound like you're actually in that seasonal of a business. People have, like
[45] Guest: I mean, I started with that, but, like, catering happens year round. I mean, shoot. I cater every single week.
[46] Host: Yeah. So we we we do large events. So, typically, kind of 60 to a 100 people. Mhmm. Gonna be, like, birthday parties, engagements, weddings there all year round. But a lot of the corporate rush that comes through in summer for end of year staff parties,
[47] Host: things of that nature, that's what it takes us, like, well beyond
[48] Host: our capacity, which gives us that busy season. And then through winter, we just we lose a lot of that. You subsist in the not in the off season.
[49] Guest: Correct? You like lose money or break even in the off season?
[50] Host: No. No. We're still profitable. We have a really good we have strong gross profit and strong margins. So we're still good. Okay. I'm just glad to make more money. Yeah. Okay. Got it.
[51] Guest: Okay. So a couple of things. So
[52] Guest: currently, how are you getting customers?
[53] Host: We have really strong organic SEO, and we also do a lot of
[54] Host: Google Ads.
[55] Host: Okay.
[56] Host: That's the most that's the main channels. So we have probably 50%
[57] Host: organic,
[58] Host: probably 40% organic, 40% ads, 20% referral.
[59] Guest: Okay. It's just some top of funnel and mess up, but it's less tracked.
[60] Host: It's more more about brand awareness. Got it. So SEO and PPC kinda kinda rule rule the day.
[61] Guest: Okay. So what stops you from spending more PPC? Are you maxed out? Like, is it stopping profitable? Like, what's what's stopping you there?
[62] Host: Search volume and, like, quarterly drops through winter.
[63] Host: Okay.
[64] Host: Back to LTV is still strong at a 12 to one, so we can just spend more. Uh-huh. I'm trying to find my my I guess, my constraint or my my question
[65] Host: my main question becomes I have considered popping up a corporate delivery, like a prepackaged
[66] Host: Right. Typical corporate catering setting Mhmm. Through Yatta to be a kind of entity under catered by Matt, which would be a year round service because they have a very inverted
[67] Host: seasonality to the event side. Yeah. They're like the corporate to order in more of that delivery, but it's it's I don't wanna get distracted. Like, I'll watch one of your content. I don't wanna chase the woman in the red dress. Yeah. Because it's a whole new business.
[68] Guest: Yeah.
[69] Guest: Well, I guess the, like, the problem that we're trying to solve here, like, you are profitable. You're running 40% even in the fact that there's on and off cycle.
[70] Guest: So to grow the business, we could ignore the fact that it's lumpy. I'll give you two examples of this. So
[71] Guest: Harry and David's, it's a chocolate company here in The US, does,
[72] Guest: like, 100% of their annual profit in the month of December.
[73] Guest: And then the other eleven months of the year, they have their mall location, and they just lose money.
[74] Guest: That's number one. Others, if you look at, like, insurance, right,
[75] Guest: insurance makes money every year. And then every eighth year, there's a hurricane Katrina, and they lose a bunch of money.
[76] Guest: And so I think what we what we need to replace is the difference between volatility and risk.
[77] Guest: So you can have something that is volatile but not risky. So insurance is volatile but not risky.
[78] Guest: Same as this chocolate thing. It's volatile in the fact that it changes a lot month to month to month, but it's not risky because it's predictable. You know that every season this is going to happen. And so if we know it's going to happen, then we can predict it. If we can predict it, we can plan for it. Right? So
[79] Guest: all that to say, if we change nothing about the business, but you simply did twice as much, what stops you from doing that?
[80] Host: Nothing.
[81] Host: Okay.
[82] Host: Everything everything's quite efficient, to be to be frank. We can we can just spend more, hire more Well, then then I think you have have that answer. I think what what feels annoying is you just wish that
[83] Guest: you know, if you're Harry and David's, you wish that the other eleven months of the year, people celebrated chocolate as much. Right?
[84] Guest: But you're just gonna have a slow season and a hot season, and that's fine, especially especially since you're not losing money in the off season.
[85] Guest: So I don't think you actually have a big problem to solve here. Think we just need to do more of what's working.
[86] Guest: I
[87] Guest: wish I could pull some magic
[88] Guest: business model out of a hat, but if you're profitable all the months of the year and then some months you just make more money,
[89] Guest: that just sounds like a business that has a predictable cycle.
[90] Host: Right.
[91] Guest: I mean, think about the alternative. It could be unpredictable. That would suck.
[92] Host: Yeah. No. It's it's it's it's almost predictable to the to the percent, to be honest. It's pretty pretty consistent.
[93] Host: I've I've been trying to contemplate, how to get around this without actually starting a new business, and I'll just I've been thinking about it for a couple of years. I thought may maybe Alex would figure something out, but I I maybe this is just that, hey, it's just a feature. No. What I would like to do is just focus all of your time on not trying to solve that problem and solving the more important problem, which is like how do we double PPC and probably get meta ads going?
[94] Guest: Like if you did nothing else this year, double p c PPC and just cracked meta ads, you'd hit your goal.
[95] Host: Yep. So it's like if you can double the business doing one thing, why do four?
[96] Host: Yeah. Touche.
[97] Host: Right?
[98] Host: Yeah.
[99] Guest: That's it, man. I mean, whole point of of theory of constraints is focus. And it's just being able to say all the things you say no to. Like, there's such limited resources in a small business. The biggest one being your time, your effort, and your mental bandwidth. If you can just say, like, I'm not looking at this anymore because this is just a feature of my business, and I'm so grateful because all my competitors will be distracted by the shiny object. Like, let them worry about that while you just keep crushing it.
[100] Guest: And them. Okay.
[101] Host: Cool? Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Appreciate you, man. Congratulations.
[102] Host: Thank you. Alright. Thanks, brother. Talk soon.
[103] Host: Bye bye.
[104] Guest: Toodaloo.
[105] Guest: Cheerio,
[106] Guest: As they say. Also, those of you who were in the chat who asked how you get on the calls,
[107] Guest: these are people these lovely business owners are business owners who bought
[108] Guest: a mega bundle of books during my best last book launch.
[109] Guest: And they're in a community on school right now, which has been closed to the public and opens up March 1.
[110] Guest: And so if you and so I select people from that community. It's for million dollar plus business owners. If you want to
[111] Guest: check it out, you can go to school.com/acq.
[112] Guest: You can join the wait list. It opens up March 1. Alright.
[113] Guest: Caller.
